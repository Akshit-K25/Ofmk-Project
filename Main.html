        <h2>Information Security Policy</h2>
        <p>The employees of OFMK are committed to ensure confidentiality, 
            integrity and availability of information, information processing facilities and information processes on 
             IT infrastructure located at OFMK.</p>
        <h3>Do's and Dont's</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Restrict access to the authorized persons only.</li>
            <li>Protect your computer and your network ID by Complex Password at different levels. <br> 
                Guidelines for your Password:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Never leave your password blank</li>
                    <li>Password must be atleast 6 characters in length.</li>
                    <li>Password must be a combination of alphabets, numbers and special characters.</li>
                    <li>Do not use common names like your Surname, Spouse's name, Date of birth, appointment,
                         Unit's name or Pet's for password as they can be easily guessed.</li>
                    <li>Change your password atleast once a month.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>If you have to leave your computer unattended for a while, use screen server
                 with password to deny access to other users.</li>
            <li>Log off the network, if you are not working of the computer.</li>
            <li>Ensure that hard disk of the computer is removed and kept at a secure place
                 before handling over computer for repair.</li>
            <li>Keep log book of your computer updated.</li>
            <li>Co-operate with Cyber Security Team during suprise checks.</li>
            <li>Take necessary precautions against natural, manmade hazards like fire, rain, dust etc.</li>
            <li>Use UPS unit to prevent damage to computer Hardware, Software and Data due to power fluctuation.</li>
            <li>If the computer system is used for very sensitive applications, use metallic shielded cabinets in the room.</li>
            <li>Software tools like Device lock may be used to block unwanted storage devices/drives,
                 ports and other external accessories.</li>
            <li>Conduct periodic audits and suprise checks for past activity on the computer system.</li>
            <li>Have a virus vaccine loaded on the DOS/WINDOWS Operating System based computers.
                Choose LINUX/UNIX and similar secure OSS as far as possible, as it
                remains the least affected by the computer viruses.</li>
            <li>Before deleting sensitive files, overwrite them several times (times
                and above) with some junk data to prevent restoration of the original
                data by any means.
            </li>
            <li>Keep the software maintenance Tool (SMT) for detecting and
                rectifying any fault in the softwares, in proper custody. Outside services
                engineers should not be allowed to use their own floppies as under this
                cover they may copy data from the system. The SMTS should be made
                available to the service engineers as and when needed.</li>
            <li>Deleting, Modification of Data or Printing any information
                from the system should be done under proper authorization.</li>
            <li>The floppies/Cartridge Tapes and Re-writeable CDs are to be treated
                as sensitive documents. Exchange of Floppies, Cartridge tapes and Re-
                Writeable CDs should be dealt with the same security procedures as
                required for hard-copies of documents.</li>
            <li>Damaged and unusable Floppies/Cartridge Tapes and Re-Writeable CDs should be broken
                into pieces and destroyed by burning and a record of such destruction should be maintained.</li>
            <li>All used printer ribbons, carbons, draft memos and reports, unused
                printouts, etc. should be destroyed by burning.</li>
            <li>Rectification of faults and maintenance should be carried out under proper and close supervision.</li>
            <li>In case the shift system is in vogue, there should be proper handing
                and take over of charge between shifts in charges.</li>
            <li>Use effective encryption techniques while communicating sensitive information over the communication network.
                 Commercially available encryption keys are known to others.</li>
            <li>Carry out periodical verification of character and antecedents of computer personnel handling critical functions.</li>
            <li>Use effective identification, authentication and acknowledgement
                 while exchanging information between two remote locations.</li>
            <li>Use stand alone computer for Internet. No office work whatsoever should be done on this computer. 
                Departmental LAN should not be provided on these terminals.</li>
            <li>Keep information related skills and knowledge updated.</li>
            <li>Whenever necessary, carry CD's/Floppy's/Flash Drive and other
                secondary storage device with an Authority Letter duly signed by concerned JS.</li>
            <li>Report any hardware, software or network problem to your System
                Administrator. Don't attempt to rectify the same by yourself.</li>
            <li>Report any violations, virus attacks or compromises in the
                information security to CISO/Director(IS)/Administrator of DDP immediately.</li>
            <li>Maintain the system securely and ensure that the Computer System is always under watch 
                to avoid any un-authorised access or compromise. It is better to have Hardware locks 
                in the cabinets in which the computer system is housed or the same is under a constant watch.</li>
            <li>Take periodic backup of Software and Data on Floppies, CDs or Cartridge Tapes and keep them under safe custody. 
                One copy of the backup may be kept at a different location. This is to be done where the information is to be secured
                and may be required for the future purposes.</li>
            <li>All Floppies, Cartridge Tapes/Re-Writeable CDs, etc. issued to users
                should be sequentially numbered preferably with the organisations
                logo. Proper records of these media should be kept and periodical
                checks carried out.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Dont's</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Do not share your complete hard disk over the network. Share only
                certain folders and restrict access to these folders by a password.</li>
            <li>Do not include any confidential information in your shared folders.</li>
            <li>Do not connect the Internet by dial up modem with the computer

            <li>Do not connect the Internet on the Terminal with departmental LAN.</li>
            <li>Do not tamper with network settings like the addresses or attempt
                to load software/programme other than those authorized by System Administrator.</li>
            <li>Don't attempt to rectify any fault by yourself.</li>
            <li>No heavy electric load drawing machines like plain paper copier, 
                shredding machines, coolers etc. should be connected to the source of
                constant voltage power supply to the computer.</li>
            <li>Don't connect computer system storing classified data to Internet.</li>
            <li>Don't allow staff members to bring their own Floppies/Rewriteable CDs to run

                and an unsuspecting easy medium for anintruder to break into your computer system.</li>
            <li>Don t loan Software Programme Disks/Re-writeable CDs, as these
                may be returned with Virus. If however, it becomes unavoidable, loan
                only a copy and the original media.</li>
            <li>Do not use internal CD Writer or COMBO drives, unless specifically authorized.</li>
            <li>Don't use any Pen drives, unless specifically authorized.</li>
